# Authentication Debug Guide

## Current Status

Based on your Convex logs, authentication IS working:
```
7/25/2025, 11:45:48 PM [CONVEX M(auth:store)] [INFO] '`auth:store` type: createAccountFromCredentials'
7/25/2025, 11:45:48 PM [CONVEX M(auth:store)] [INFO] '`auth:store` type: signIn'
```

This means:
1. ✅ Account was created successfully
2. ✅ User was signed in automatically 
3. ❌ React Native app is not detecting the auth state change

## Debug Steps

### 1. Check React Native Console

After clicking "Create Account", you should see these logs in your React Native console:
```
Starting sign up process...
Attempting to sign up with: {email: "your@email.com"}
Sign up successful
Auth state should be updated now
Index Screen - Auth State: {isLoading: false, isAuthenticated: true}
User is authenticated, redirecting to tabs
```

### 2. If You Don't See Auth State Change

The issue might be with the Convex React client not syncing properly. Try:

1. **Restart both servers**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   npx convex dev
   
   # Terminal 2 
   npm start
   ```

2. **Clear React Native cache**:
   ```bash
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

### 3. Force Test Authentication

To test if the authenticated screens work, temporarily modify `app/index.tsx`:

```typescript
// Add this at the top of the component
if (true) { // Force authenticated state
  return <Redirect href="/(tabs)" />;
}
```

This will skip auth checking and take you directly to the main app.

### 4. Check Environment Variables

Verify your `.env.local` file contains:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3210
AUTH_SECRET=b695faec1dbe05e8077acc35b907e31d8891e3a70e5d3baba80873af7f814845
```

## Expected Behavior

1. Click "Create Account"
2. See Convex logs showing account creation ✅ (You see this)
3. React Native app detects auth state change ❌ (This is failing)
4. App redirects to `/(tabs)` home screen

## Quick Fix

If the auth state detection continues to fail, you can manually verify authentication works by:

1. **Check Convex Dashboard**: Go to your Convex dashboard and look at the `users` table - you should see your created user
2. **Force redirect**: Temporarily modify the index screen to always redirect to tabs
3. **Debug auth hook**: Add more logging to `useConvexAuth()` to see what's happening

The authentication backend is working perfectly - it's just a React state synchronization issue.
