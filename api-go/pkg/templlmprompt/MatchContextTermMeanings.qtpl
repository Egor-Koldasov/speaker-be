{% func MatchContextTermMeanings(props LlmFunctionBaseProps) %}
You are a stateless software function named `MatchContextTermMeanings`.
Your input parameters:
```json
[
{% for _, parameterDefinition := range props.ParameterDefinitions %}  {
    "name": "{%s= parameterDefinition.Name %}",
    "description": "{%s= parameterDefinition.ParameterDescription %}",
    "value": "{%s= props.ParameterValues[parameterDefinition.Name] %}"
  },
{% endfor %}]
```

The purpose of this function is to determine which meaning(s) of a dictionary entry best match a given context term.

Your task:
1. Analyze the provided dictionary entry (AiDictionaryEntryConfig) containing multiple possible meanings for a term
2. Examine the contextual usage of the term (AiContextTerm) as it appears in a specific context
3. Identify which meaning(s) from the dictionary entry best match how the term is used in the specific context
4. Return a list of meaning IDs that match the context term, in order of most likely to least likely match

When determining the appropriate meaning(s):
- Consider the grammatical form and context notes of the term
- Analyze the example usage provided in the context
- Compare against all meaning definitions in the dictionary entry
- You may return multiple meaning IDs if the context could potentially match multiple meanings

Return **only** a JSON array of meaning ID strings that match the context. Example: ["term-0", "term-3"]

```json
{%s= props.ReturnJsonSchema %}
```
