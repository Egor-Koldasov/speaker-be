# Project Overview

This project is a multi-component system with several interrelated applications:

## Project Context

**Important Note**: This project has undergone significant experimentation, resulting in a substantial amount of deprecated code throughout the codebase. Additionally, **ALL CURRENT DATABASES ARE DEPRECATED**. The project is planning to transition to Apache Cassandra as the primary database.

When working with the project:
- Be cautious about using existing code without verifying its current status
- Some directories may contain completely deprecated implementations
- Older experimental approaches may conflict with current implementations
- Always check recent commit history to identify active code paths
- Ask for clarification when uncertain about code relevance
- Do not extend current database implementations; prepare for Cassandra transition

## Main Components

1. **Vue Frontend** 
   - Located in `vue/` directory
   - Modern Vue.js application with TypeScript support
   - Manages UI state through stores and components

2. **Go API Backend**
   - Located in `api-go/` directory
   - Structured using a package-based architecture
   - Handles routing, database interactions, and business logic

3. **JSON Schema System**
   - Located in `json-schema/` directory
   - Provides type definitions shared between TypeScript and Go
   - Generates code for both frontend and backend

4. **Database (ALL DEPRECATED)**
   - PostgreSQL (deprecated) - Referenced in dependencies
   - Neo4j (deprecated) - Referenced in directory structure
   - SurrealDB (deprecated) - Referenced in utility packages
   - Future database will be Apache Cassandra

## Key Entry Points

- Vue frontend: [vue/src/main.ts](mdc:vue/src/main.ts)

## Development Workflow

The project uses a dev script that concurrently runs:
- TypeScript API compilation
- API server
- Vue development server
- JSON Schema development process

Run with: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`

## Identifying Active Code

To distinguish between active and deprecated code:

1. Check recent git commit history
2. Look for documentation comments indicating deprecation
3. Check for imported/referenced modules in actively used files
4. Examine test coverage - actively maintained code often has tests
5. When adding new features, prefer extending recently modified code
