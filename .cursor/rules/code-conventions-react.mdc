*After any code changes you make, verify them against these code conventions to make sure the update code follows them completely. In cases when it is not possible to follow a convention, add a corresponding explanation.*

### When rendering conditional parts in React components, avoid ternary conditionals
Wrong example, do not do this:
```TypeScript
{cond ? <Component1 /> : <Component2 />}
```
Correct example, do this instead:
```TypeScript
{!!cond && <Component1 />}
{!cond && <Component2 />}
```
