# Database Architecture

## Current Database Status

**ALL CURRENT DATABASE IMPLEMENTATIONS ARE DEPRECATED AND WILL BE REMOVED**

No data migration is planned as no critical data is currently stored in any database. The project will transition to using Apache Cassandra exclusively.

## Future Database: Apache Cassandra

- Will be the sole database system for the project
- Distributed NoSQL database designed for high availability and scalability
- Well-suited for time-series data and large-scale applications
